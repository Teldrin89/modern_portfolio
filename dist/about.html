          <p>
            I have over 6 years of experience as a design engineer, and have
            worked for most of that time at Warsaw Institute of Aviation (WIA)
            for GE Oil & Gas (currently BHGE) in the centrifugal compressor
            team. While I get most of my experience in mechanical and aero
            design of centrifugal compressor I have also been involved in tasks
            that required some programming knowledge. I started with simple
            VBA macros in excel, went through advanced VBA with callouts for
            external scripts and finished with tool that combined the VBA excel
            tool with HYSYS process simulation software. My most recent work
            include development of performance analytics for reciprocating
            compressor using Python.

          <p>
            I graduated from University of Science and Technology in Krakow
            (AGH) for both my B.Sc. (2011) and M.Sc. (2013) in Power
            Engineering. During my 5 years at collage I have been involved in
            numerous extra curriculum activities such as participation (and
            co-creation!) of science club - Ignis - at the department of Energy
            and Fuels.

          <h3>Current position</h3>
          <h6>Lead Engineer</h6>
          <p>
            I am currently involved in work around the design of centrifugal
            compressors and expanders for various applications (O&G in most cases).
            I've taken part in several NPI (New Product Introduction) projects for new types of compressor units - for example HPRC (High Pressure Ratio
            Compressor).

        <div class="job job-3">
          <h3>Aditional work</h3>
          <h6>Software Engineer</h6>
          <p>
            My software engineer work is partially related to current job - I
            have been the creator of performance prediction tool for new type of
            compressor (VBA excel tool with HYSYS callouts). More recently I
            have also been involved in co-creation of reciprocating compressors
            analytics using Python. I also consider software engineering my
            hobby and work on my own projects (this portfolio page for example)
            and take part in competitions (Halite 3). Most recently I've been working
            on simple Lua games (check "My Work").
