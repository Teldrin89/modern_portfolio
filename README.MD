## GENERAL INFORMATION
This respoistory is used to store and publish information about me and my work.
It was prepared several years ago (2018) using YT video guidelines.

## CURRENT STATUS
I would like to update this repository and change several key components.
1. The web page should be simplified from technical standpoint to just HTML, CSS
and JS - removing the node.js modules of which there are a lot and almost none are
used
2. The general split of information shall remain as it was:
    - Information about me
    - How to reach me
    - My additional work
3. Each section should feel slightly different. Regarding information about me
it should be general with option to check for more details. In how to reach me
there should be all platforms and ways to contact/check me. Section on my
additional work should have sort of blog-like structure with place for more
freequent updates. Each individual project can have it's dedicated page as well.
4. Archive old Lua games as single project
